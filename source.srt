1
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,790
Water, come forth.

2
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,900
The Water Magician

3
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,760
Where am I...?

4
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,860
Just so you know, this isn't the afterlife.

5
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,300
You are Ryo Mihara, yes?

6
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,840
Yes, that's me.

7
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,620
That's a relief. It's been a long
time since I last had a visitor.

8
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,690
Ryo Mihara, you sadly
passed away in an accident.

9
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,630
Right. I remember that.

10
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,810
Are you... god?

11
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:26,400
No, I am not. To put it into terms
you'd be familiar with...

12
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,190
an angel would be most apt, I believe.

13
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,610
I'll file him as "Fake Michael" for now.

14
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,640
I understand I'm being reincarnating,
but what do I do once I start my new life?

15
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,620
By all means, live however you please.

16
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,870
I was not informed that
you'd been sent with an agenda

17
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,850
or any sort of mission to complete.

18
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm to live as I please?

19
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,070
In that case, I'd love to live the slow life.

20
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,590
The world you will be reincarnating
into is one full of magic.

21
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,370
Abel?

22
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,730
We have dubbed this world "Phi."

23
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,090
In Phi, roughly 20 percent
of humans can cast spells.

24
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,740
The element with which
you are most compatible is water.

25
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,270
As you've requested the slow life, we'll have
you reincarnate in the Forest of Rondo.

26
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,570
A house and two months'
worth of food will await you.

27
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,190
An icehouse for storing food?
This has got to be magic too, right?

28
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,570
Your house has been prepared so that monsters
will avoid the immediate vicinity.

29
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,430
Consider it to be something like a barrier.

30
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,750
The Monster Compendium, Beginner Edition?

31
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,990
I can read it even though
I've never seen the language.

32
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,440
This Flora Compendium, too.

33
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,110
Water, come forth.

34
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,750
Water! Aqua!

35
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,460
I guess if I can imagine what I'm doing,
I don't need to vocalize it.

36
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,330
I've always thought incantations
were cool, though...

37
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,000
Looks like what I conjure is tepid.

38
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,390
And here I was hoping to make good use
of this nice tub. That bites.

39
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,880
Oh well.

40
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,340
Not happening!

41
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,990
Gotta know when to give up.

42
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,440
The sun?

43
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,430
Freeze!

44
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,340
This is harder than I thought.

45
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,610
But I need to figure out how to make ice, too.

46
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,560
I'd love to cast one of those
"Ice Spear" kinds of spells.

47
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,720
Compress the water while removing the heat...

48
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,690
Picture the H2O molecules
at the heart of the water.

49
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,740
If I can connect an oxygen atom to the
hydrogen atom of the molecule next to it...

50
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,790
I win! And all thanks to hydrogen bonds.

51
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,170
Now, if I can shape it how I need...

52
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,520
Bingo!

53
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,920
I'd say that was a pretty
productive first day.

54
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,150
I think I can make hot water
if I apply the thinking that got me ice.

55
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,060
Magic sure makes life easy.

56
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,480
Now then, I've got plenty to do tomorrow.

57
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,690
Michael prepared two months of food for me.

58
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,600
I guess that means I'll have to start
hunting once I work through my supply.

59
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,970
The woods fall outside of the barrier,
so there will be monsters.

60
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,050
I doubt a single knife will be enough.
I'm going to need offensive magic.

61
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,510
For a secure and safe slow life,
I had better start practicing, huh?

62
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,730
Water Ball!

63
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,440
My first attack spell is a success!

64
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,230
Although... not much of an attack.

65
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,360
I mean, that makes sense.

66
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,940
Nevertheless, I have a trick up my sleeve.

67
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,210
If Water Ball won't cut it,
then out comes Water Jet.

68
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,700
Narrow the outlet. Picture
a thin, high-velocity stream.

69
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,940
Go!

70
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,080
I lose.

71
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,180
Oh, one last thing. How do I use magic?

72
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,190
The foundation to magic is imagination.

73
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,650
Water Jet!

74
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,480
You need to picture clearly what you're
aiming for, then work toward that over time.

75
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,650
Water Jet!

76
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,420
Water Jet!

77
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,870
It's looking a bit better now.

78
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,410
Good!

79
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,870
Seems I was right about using the
opposite process for ice to get hot water.

80
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,220
Hot! Too hot!

81
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,040
Creating ice out of thin air...

82
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,010
It's not fast, but looks like it's doable.

83
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,500
Which leads us to my main goal
for offensive ice magic: Icicle Lance!

84
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,270
Now fly!

85
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,540
Guess it's not as easy to project as water.

86
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,130
Given the difficulty of conjuring it
and its limited range,

87
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,620
I have my doubts about practical
applications in combat.

88
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,970
For now, practice makes perfect.

89
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,320
I feel like I'm going to pass out.
Is this some kind of... mana depletion?

90
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,290
Oh, of course. I can't do this the way
I have been once the sun sets.

91
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,880
Icicle Lance!

92
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Good. I'm able to form them instantly now.

93
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,600
Still not much of a projectile, though.

94
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,850
Now then, it's time to venture...

95
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,290
outside of the barrier!

96
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,070
Bingo!

97
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,210
Quartz! I had a feeling I'd
find this along a riverbank.

98
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,920
And with it...

99
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,750
I can start a fire even
after the sun goes down.

100
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,740
Once I collect some detoxifying herbs,
I'll call today's adventure a success.

101
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,020
A lesser boar!

102
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,980
This is bad.

103
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,740
Move... Move, move, move, move, move!

104
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,800
I can't move...
But in this world, I have magic!

105
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,680
Ice Bahn!

106
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,390
Icicle Lance 16!

107
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,670
I won...

108
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,870
Lesser boars are listed as the weakest kind.

109
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,320
That was the weakest, huh?

110
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,910
This Monster Compendium
is the beginner's edition,

111
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,420
but it says the last two pages
are the special edition?

112
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,010
"Dragons. Individually capable
of destroying entire cities with ease."

113
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,960
Scary!

114
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,390
"Note: If you encounter one,
be sure to flee."

115
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,630
"That said, you are highly
unlikely to escape." I see.

116
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,650
Just running into one is game over.

117
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,620
"Akuma. Not fallen angels."

118
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,320
"Origins unknown.
Note: Pray you never encounter one."

119
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,300
Is that really going to help?

120
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,930
Man, this world must be huge.

121
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,430
That's a great balance of sweet and sour!

122
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,240
A bird?!

123
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,060
This seems like a huge jump
in terms of difficulty!

124
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,740
Assassin hawks use Air Slash,
an invisible type of offensive air magic.

125
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,410
But their main weapons is swooping
with their razor-sharp talons and beak!

126
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,290
I don't think I can outrun it.

127
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,580
I'll just have... to fight back!

128
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,140
This slow life thing is harder than I figured...

129
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:18,180
While I was running from the assassin hawk,
I lost track of the direction my house is in.

130
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,320
I should be getting closer, I think...

131
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,070
Abrasive Jet!

132
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,660
Hey, it worked!

133
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,150
If I use magic to enhance
the hardness of ice,

134
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,620
it can act as a replacement
for garnet blasting abrasive.

135
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,870
I might actually be getting the hang of magic.

136
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,810
The beginner edition's of the Monster
Compendium didn't mention a Dullahan.

137
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,000
Is it not considered a monster? Or is it
too advanced for the beginner's edition?

138
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,450
Either way...

139
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,010
I've got you!

140
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,720
I don't think I stand a chance just yet.

141
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,010
But there's a reason I come here every night.

142
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,190
It feels like he's telling me
he'll whip me into shape.

143
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,910
A water sword?

144
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,300
You're telling me to master it?

145
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,020
This is pretty fantastical.

146
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,360
The assassin hawk from before?

147
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,310
Wait, it wasn't that dark.

148
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,750
Did it evolve?

149
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,420
Five-Layer Ice Wall.

150
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,430
Ten-Layer Ice Wall!

151
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,690
Ice Wall!

152
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,440
Icicle Lance!

153
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,450
It wiped them out?!

154
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,300
Does it have some kind of magic negation?
What a nasty ability to evolve!

155
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,870
Something's... coming!

156
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,580
I get it. I took your eye.

157
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,230
Even if we both gave it all
and you lost, it's still hard to accept.

158
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,450
But if nothing else, encountering
you has helped me grow.

159
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,910
I wanted to get stronger in anticipation
of you showing up again.

160
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,400
I'm grateful you gave me
the chance to improve.

161
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,930
You went as far as to evolve
in order to pay me back.

162
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,440
And out of respect for the pride that
brought you here... I'll finish this.

163
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,910
Unbelievable.

164
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
A dragon...

165
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,650
You there, human!

166
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,830
It talks?

167
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:38,050
Good, good. It's been so long since I used
telepathy, I wasn't sure it'd still work.

168
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,510
Telepathy?

169
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,270
I was hoping to ask you something.

170
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,980
Have you encountered a bird that evolved
from an assassin hawk around here?

171
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,340
I, er... I have.

172
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,860
That wasn't one of your
minions or anything, was it?

173
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,990
Because if so, I need to apologize.

174
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,240
I see! Then you've slain the creature.

175
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,070
A most impressive feat.

176
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,920
Now, I must say, that's a rather
rare weapon at your waist.

177
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,590
As I thought! The sword of the Fairy King!

178
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,050
If he gave that to you, then you must've
done something to earn his favor!

179
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,610
I couldn't really say...

180
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,440
But, uh, I was hoping
to ask you a few questions.

181
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,130
You'll have to forgive me,
but I'm being called on.

182
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,820
I was so enjoying our little chat, too.

183
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,660
It's okay. I really appreciate
everything you told me.

184
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,080
Could I at least get your name? Mine is Ryo.

185
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,830
Ryo, eh? I'm Lewin.

186
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,050
Until we meet again, Ryo!

187
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,970
Talk about intense...

188
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,550
Never thought I'd have a
conversation with a dragon.

189
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,140
Anything can happen in a
fantasy world like this, huh?

190
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,320
Oh, dear. What an oversight on my part.

191
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,280
A hidden trait?
Why would he have such a thing?

192
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,750
No one's had one of those since
that girl I first sent to another world.

193
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,600
That was over ten thousand years ago.

194
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,840
In Ryo's case, his hidden trait is...
Eternal Youth.
